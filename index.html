    <h3>Dear Friends and Family</h3>
    <p>As you probably know, we are in the process of a total transformation at Little Palm Island Resort & Spa. We appreciate all of the support and interest in the status of the project, and we thank you for checking in on us.</p>
    <p>We know that our valued guests will be thrilled to learn of the many enhancements planned for the island. We have paid great attention to all that was loved about the Little Palm Island experience, and are planning to preserve the standard of excellence you have come to expect, while also adding some new and opulent extras.</p>
    <p>Though the project is not forecasted to be complete until early 2019, we would love to share all the latest news with you. Likewise, we are aware that there is great interest from those who have yet to visit us. We hope to welcome you to our hidden paradise soon.</p>
